# Heroes of the Aturi Cluster ship builder

This project is a web based squad roster builder and campaign tracker for the "Heroes of the Aturi Cluster" campaign for the x-wing miniatures game. It provides and interface to list a hotac squadron and track chnages as a campaign progresses.

A live version can be found at: [http://hotac-squad-roster.netlify.com](http://hotac-squad-roster.netlify.com)

The project is written entirely in javascript and html. Styling is generated using the Sass preprocessor.

Thsi project owes many thanks to two x-wing projects without which, this would have not been possible:
* [x-wing miniatures data](https://github.com/guidokessels/xwing-data)
* [x-wing miniatures font](https://github.com/geordanr/xwing-miniatures-font)
